# GR5243_Applied-Data-Science-Course-Materials-and-Individual-Projects

Course Materials and homeworks of Applied Data Science.

The homeworks are individual projects of a big topic with many subquestions and requirements。

Please be aware that there materials can just be used for personal study. DO NOT use them for profit.

Professor David Shilane is one of the best and the most patient professor I met in Columbia University. 
He spent lots of time prepare for coures materials and assignments even though he is a co-founder and a data scientist of a company in Mew York.
I wrote lot of email to him to ask question while doing indicidual, midterm and final projects and he always responsed within 10 minutes,
which makes him to be the most patient professor I have ever met.

Back to this course, the informations about it are as follows:

Target Audience

This course is intended for masters degree students in Statistics and Data Science.  The prerequisite skills include the completion of introductory courses in computer programming and statistics.  Familiarity with machine learning algorithms and R programming is recommended but not required. 
The course will provide an opportunity to make significant progress with the R programming language, including the use of advanced techniques and developing applications.
Objectives

1.	Gaining an appreciation for the practical challenges of data science projects, anticipating the obstacles of working with messy data,
and devising structures that streamline the work of generating insights.

2.	Understanding the aims and challenges of several representative industries and applications of data science.

3.	Exploring the techniques for obtaining and preparing data for analysis.

4.	Applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithmsm to solve problems in diverse applications.

5.	Developing skills in the software tools that enable these analyses.


Course Content

Data Science is uniquely positioned at the intersection of scientific inquiries, engineering systems, and knowledge of the domain of inquiry.  Answering difficult questions with the best available information is the goal of every analysis.  However, nearly every project in data science has unique challenges.  How to answer a question — or determining whether it can be answered at all — depends greatly on the type, structure, and quality of the available data.  The path and success of an investigation can be shaped by the practical challenges encountered along the way.
This course will introduce students to the practical side of Data Science.  Through a variety of case studies, the students will gain exposure to settings in which the choice of the design may greatly impact the direction of the project.  The case studies will emphasize how to adapt the project’s plans according to changing objectives, early setbacks, or unforeseen circumstances.  These practical lessons in planning and critical thinking can help a data scientist anticipate these issues and address them in the early stages of the analysis.  Through the experience of the course, the students will gain a sense of how to iteratively develop their projects to incorporate feedback and facilitate extensions to the work. 
At the same time, practical experience can also provide insight into the theoretical aspects and applications of statistics and data science.  While exploring the challenges of working with real data, the course will reinforce the student’s understanding of the standard methods of analyses, machine learning algorithms, techniques for software developement, and applications across many industries.
The course will feature intensive training in R, with an emphasis on progressing to advanced methods, efficient computations, and building applications.  This portion of the curriculum will enhance the students’ ability to investigate data and generate results.  The homework assignments and projects are designed to help the students learn how to use software to improve the productivity, accuracy, and quality of their work.  The course will also emphasize reproducibility and documentation to generate transparent and accountable results.
Practice Areas

We will focus on the practice of Data Science in the following industries:

•	Educational Assessment

•	Health Care

•	Marketing and Advertising

•	Social Media and Online Businesses

Exploring the application of data science in these industries will illustrate the range of information, analytical methods, 
and technologies used to solve challenging problems. While these industries have different goals, many common themes emerge across them. 
Quite often the lessons of one industry are directly relevant to others.  Using case studies, the students will be prepared for some of 
the challenges that arise in these industries and be able to adapt these lessons to other areas.


Methods

In the context of this work, we will focus on a number of applications and methods:

•	Information retrieval and efficient data processing

•	Basic methods of data analysis

•	Methods and algorithms in statistics and machine learning

•	Feature engineering and structuring investigations

•	Reproducible research and reporting

•	Interpreting results

•	Communication skills

Nearly every project in data science requires a wide range of techniques. We will investigate challenges in processing and understanding
large amounts of messy data. Data analysis methods from statistics and machine learning will be applied to solve challenging problems 
across a variety of applications.  The students will also learn the paradigms of reproducible research and reporting, 
which provide a greater degree of transparency and opportunities to improve productivity.  
In addition, learning how to interpret and effectively communicate the results of a project will enable the student’s teams and 
organizations to make informed decisions based on the available data.


Software Skills

The implementation of data science methods requires a number of technical skills.  Developing strong computer programming abilities 
enables a data scientist to generate insights from the available data.  The course will teach and emphasize the R programming language.
Starting from an introductory level, the students will learn and develop advanced methods and techniques, including:

•	Extracting data from multiple sources

•	Exploring, organizing, and cleaning data

•	The data.table package for efficient computations and data processing

•	The Rmarkdown package for generating reproducible reports

•	The shiny and flexdashboard packages to construct user interfaces and dynamic reporting engines

•	Database connections

•	Statistical methods and machine learning packages

•	Creating elegant, reusable, and readable code

•	Using flexible structures to adapt to changing needs in a report over time.

Throughout the course, we will provide relevant examples of how to work with data, implement analytical methods, 
and create reports using computational tools.  Comparative examples showcasing different approaches to solving a problem will be 
highlighted with a discussion of the relative benefits of different programming techniques.
